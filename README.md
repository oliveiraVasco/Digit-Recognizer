# Digit-Recognizer
This project is an approach to Kaggle's digit recognition challenge. It's used python's version of the mxnet package, which allows GPU processing, to train a deep learning network. This project is inspired on the tutorial [Handwritten Digit Recognition](http://mxnet.io/tutorials/python/mnist.html).
